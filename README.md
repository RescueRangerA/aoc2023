# Advent of Code 23 in Java

My [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) solutions in the Java programming language.

## Run solutions

1. Pick a day (for example "1")
2. Put your input in [resources/dayInputs](src/main/resources/dayInputs)
3. Rename to "day{number of the day}" (for example `day1`)
4. Replace the "day" class in the [Main class](src/main/java/com/github/rescuerangera/aoc2023/Main.java) with yours (for example `(new Day1()).solve().beautifulPrint();`)
5. Run it!

## I cannot include my puzzle inputs because of [this](https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_copying):

> If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs.
